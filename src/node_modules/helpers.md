# Map/Array factory

`mapArrayFactory`

Factory for collection of objects owning one or several ids.

If you want an object to have several ids, you are forced to put these ids inside a property of this object, like this:

```javascript
[
	{
		names: ['obj1name1', 'obj1name2'],
		... // Rest
	}
	{
		names: ['obj2name1', 'obj2name2'],
		... // Rest
	}
]
```

And to have a collection of such objects, you would put it in an array.

Now imagine you have a collection of objects each containing only one id. This would be cumbersome to have to specify everytime the names property. So you would better do it like this:

```javascript
{
	obj1Name: {},
	obj2Name: {},
	...
}
```

This factory converts the latter form to the more comprehensive first one.

If you explicitely define a property name, the created objects will have only a property for the names, and the defined value inside the property name you gave, like this:

```javascript
{
	names: [...],
	nested: {...}
}
```
