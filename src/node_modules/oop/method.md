Represents an enhanced function.

# Factory

* `Function`: if you provide a function when instanciating a `Method`, it is considered to be the processing function. See `process`.

# The actual processing function

## Characterristics

* required

## Description

The actual function, called by the method with the arguments it received - those arguments might have been processed, see other sections - and the method as context/`this`.

# Describing the expected input of the method

The following section explains how you can specify what a method is expected when called.

## Names

1. `input`
1. `in`
1. `arg`
1. `argument`
1. `schema`
1. `spec`

## Characteristics

* Optional
* No default value
* Dynamic: the resulting property is applied to the returned object, unde the first name of the list above.
* No check is made

## Description

If the `input` is not void, when the method is called it will apply `dop.processProperties` on the first argument, with `input` as schema.

Then the `process` function is called with the resulting object, and the rest of the arguments untouched.

# Other

- optional: if you want to return directly a property from the spec generated from the schema, specify its name here. Makes sense only if a schema was provided
